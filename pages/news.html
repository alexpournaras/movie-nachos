						<p class="article-paragraph">Director <a href="./actor.html" class="article-link">Adam McKay</a> is selling off personal items in an auction to raise money for the Climate Emergency Fund. The "Make Me Regret This" auction features 37 lots, including movie props, comic books, trading cards, and for someone with deep pockets, a walk-on role in his next movie. The estimated final price for the walk-on role is $25,000.</p>
						<p class="article-paragraph">The auction features an eclectic mix of items, such as baseball cards, vintage wines, first edition comic books, and the Sex Panther prop from Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. However, the most unique item being offered is the chance for someone to meet McKay and have a walk-on role in his next film project. As a member of the Climate Emergency Fund Board of Directors, McKay is using his platform to raise awareness about the issue of climate change.</p>
						<p class="article-paragraph">The listing for the walk-on role in McKay's next film project states: "Adam McKay, Climate Emergency Fund Board of Director is an Academy Award-winning writer/director/producer. Adam’s most recent feature, <a href="./movie.html" class="article-link">Don’t Look Up</a>, received four Academy Award and BAFTA nominations including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, as well as a WGA Original Screenplay win for McKay.” Currently, the lot has 29 watchers but no current bids.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="article-content">
						<p class="article-paragraph">Director <a href="./actor.html" class="article-link">Tommy Wirkola</a> has confirmed that the sequel to the successful holiday action movie, <a href="./movie.html" class="article-link">Violent Night</a>, is officially in the works. The original film, which starred <a href="./actor.html" class="article-link">David Harbour</a> as a badass version of Santa Claus, was well received by audiences and did well at the box office. This led to speculation that a sequel would be announced.</p>
						<p class="article-paragraph">In an interview with TheWrap, Wirkola confirmed that the process of making Violent Night 2 has begun. The plan is for Harbour to return as Santa Claus, and for the same creative team to be involved on both sides of the camera. Wirkola will return as director and <a href="./actor.html" class="article-link">Pat Casey</a> and <a href="./actor.html" class="article-link">Josh Miller</a>, the duo who wrote the first film, will also co-write Violent Night 2.</p>
						<p class="article-paragraph">However, production for the sequel will not happen in the immediate future. Wirkola and the screenwriters want to take their time to craft a follow-up story that everyone is happy with. Wirkola stated that they have some ideas in mind, but they want to "crack the script and figure out the story." The priority is to make sure that the sequel lives up to the success of the first film.</p>
